# BMI Calculator Android App

Welcome to the **BMI Calculator Android App** repository! This project serves as a fundamental introduction to Android app development, focusing on building a simple yet effective BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator. BMI is a measure of body fat based on an individual's weight and height. This app allows users to input their weight in kilograms and height in centimeters, calculates their BMI, and provides a corresponding weight category.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The app features a clean and intuitive user interface, making it easy for users to input their weight and height values.
- **Real-Time BMI Calculation:** Upon user input, the app dynamically calculates the BMI in real time, enhancing user experience and interaction.
- **Weight Category Display:** After calculation, the app displays the calculated BMI along with the corresponding weight category (Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, or Obese), providing valuable health information to the user.

## Concepts Learned

- **XML Layout Design:** The app's user interface is designed using XML, incorporating various UI elements like TextViews, EditTexts, CardViews, and Buttons. This demonstrates proficiency in creating visually appealing layouts.
- **Event Handling:** The app utilizes event handling techniques to capture user interactions, specifically the button click event, triggering the BMI calculation process.
- **Data Validation:** The input values (weight and height) are validated to ensure they are numeric and non-null, enhancing the robustness of the application.
- **Mathematical Calculations:** The app applies mathematical operations to convert height from centimeters to meters and calculate BMI using the formula: BMI = weight / (height in meters)^2.
- **Conditional Statements:** The app employs conditional statements (when expressions) to categorize the calculated BMI into different weight categories, demonstrating control flow in programming.

## How to Use the App

1. **Input Weight and Height:** Enter your weight in kilograms and height in centimeters into the respective input fields.
2. **Calculate BMI:** Click the "Calculate" button to compute your BMI.
3. **View Results:** The app will display your calculated BMI and the corresponding weight category based on the calculated value.
4. **Invalid Input Handling:** If you enter invalid or null values, the app will display "Invalid Input."
